### Original Requirements Restatement
Transform the existing basic village development system into a comprehensive unified rural economic engine that integrates digital marketplace, aggregation hubs, logistics, finance, and community governance to connect smallholder farmers with broader markets while ensuring digital inclusion through multi-channel access (smartphones and feature phones).

## 2. Product Definition

### 2.1 Product Goals

1. **Market Integration Goal**: Connect 100,000+ smallholder farmers to formal markets within 24 months, achieving 15-25% price uplift compared to traditional mandi sales through transparent price discovery and reduced intermediation.

2. **Economic Empowerment Goal**: Enable rural economic transformation by creating 5,000+ local jobs (hub operators, logistics coordinators, field agents) and facilitating â‚¹500 crores+ in annual GMV through integrated value chain services.

3. **Digital Inclusion Goal**: Achieve 80%+ adoption rate across diverse user segments by providing seamless access through smartphones, feature phones (USSD/IVR), and SMS, ensuring no farmer is left behind due to technology barriers.

### 2.2 User Stories

**Epic 1: Farmer Market Access**
- As a smallholder farmer with a feature phone, I want to receive SMS alerts about crop demand and prices so that I can decide when and where to sell my produce for maximum profit.
- As a farmer, I want to list my produce on the digital marketplace and receive multiple bids so that I can choose the best price and pickup time.
- As a farmer, I want to access quality inputs (seeds, fertilizers) at fair prices with convenient delivery so that I can improve my crop yield and reduce input costs.

**Epic 2: Community Coordination**
- As an SHG leader, I want to coordinate collective selling for my group members so that we can achieve better prices through bulk transactions and shared logistics costs.
- As a village hub operator, I want to efficiently manage produce collection, quality grading, and inventory tracking so that I can ensure fair transactions and minimize post-harvest losses.

**Epic 3: Supply Chain Integration**
- As a buyer/aggregator, I want to access consistent quality and quantity of produce with full traceability so that I can plan my procurement and meet my customers' requirements.
- As a logistics coordinator, I want optimized pickup routes and real-time inventory visibility so that I can maximize vehicle utilization and reduce transportation costs.

**Epic 4: Financial Services**
- As a farmer, I want access to pre-harvest credit based on my transaction history so that I can invest in quality inputs without depending on informal lenders.
- As an aggregator, I want invoice financing for my purchases so that I can maintain cash flow while providing immediate payments to farmers.
