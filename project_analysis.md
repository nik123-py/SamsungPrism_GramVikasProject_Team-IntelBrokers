## Current Project Structure Analysis

### Backend Structure (Node.js/Express)
The backend follows a standard MVC architecture with the following components:

**Configuration:**
- `config.js`: Comprehensive configuration for database, Redis, JWT, email, SMS, payments, file uploads, rate limiting, and logging
- `database.js`: Database connection setup (currently empty)
- `redis.js`: Redis connection and caching utilities (implemented)

**Models:** (All currently empty)
- User.js: User management
- Village.js: Village data management  
- Project.js: Development projects
- Donation.js: Donation tracking
- Household.js: Household management

**Controllers:** (All currently empty)
- authController.js: Authentication logic
- userController.js: User management
- villageController.js: Village operations
- projectController.js: Project management
- donationController.js: Donation processing
- analyticsController.js: Analytics and reporting

**Routes:** (All currently empty)
- auth.js: Authentication endpoints
- users.js: User management endpoints
- villages.js: Village management endpoints
- projects.js: Project management endpoints
- donations.js: Donation processing endpoints
- analytics.js: Analytics endpoints

**Services:** (All currently empty)
- authService.js: Authentication business logic
- cacheService.js: Caching operations
- otpService.js: OTP generation and validation

**Middleware:** (All currently empty)
- auth.js: Authentication middleware
- validation.js: Input validation
- rateLimiter.js: Rate limiting

**Utilities:** (All currently empty)
- helpers.js: Utility functions
- logger.js: Logging utilities

### Frontend Structure (Next.js/TypeScript)
**Components:** (All currently empty)
- Dashboard components: ImpactChart, ProjectsOverview, RecentActivity, StatsCard

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Implemented Features:
1. **Configuration System**: Comprehensive configuration setup for all services
2. **Redis Integration**: Complete Redis connection and caching utilities
3. **Project Structure**: Well-organized MVC architecture

### ❌ Missing Implementation:
1. **Database Models**: All model files are empty
2. **Controllers**: No business logic implemented
3. **Routes**: No API endpoints defined
4. **Authentication**: No auth implementation
5. **Frontend Components**: All React components are empty
6. **Database Schema**: SQL schema file is empty
7. **Services**: All service files are empty
8. **Middleware**: All middleware files are empty

## Inferred Requirements (Based on Project Structure):

### Core Functionality:
1. **User Management System**
   - User registration and authentication
   - Role-based access control (likely admin, village coordinator, donor)
   - User profile management

2. **Village Management**
   - Village registration and profiles
   - Household management within villages
   - Village demographics and data

3. **Project Management**
   - Development project creation and tracking
   - Project categories (infrastructure, education, healthcare, etc.)
   - Project progress monitoring
   - Project completion tracking

4. **Donation System**
   - Online donation processing
   - Payment gateway integration (Razorpay)
   - Donation tracking and receipts
   - Donor management

5. **Analytics and Reporting**
   - Impact measurement and reporting
   - Donation analytics
   - Project progress reports
   - Village development metrics

6. **Dashboard Interface**
   - Admin dashboard for overall management
   - Village coordinator dashboard
   - Donor dashboard for tracking contributions

## Recommendations for Implementation:

### High Priority:
1. **Database Schema Design**: Create comprehensive database schema
2. **Authentication System**: Implement JWT-based authentication
3. **Core API Endpoints**: Implement essential CRUD operations
4. **Frontend Components**: Build basic dashboard and forms

### Medium Priority:
1. **Payment Integration**: Implement Razorpay payment processing
2. **File Upload System**: Implement document and image uploads
3. **Email/SMS Notifications**: Implement communication system
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Build reporting and analytics features

### Low Priority:
1. **Advanced UI/UX**: Polish frontend design
2. **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching strategies
3. **Security Enhancements**: Add additional security measures
4. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing suite

## Next Steps:
1. Define detailed database schema based on requirements
2. Implement core models and relationships
3. Build authentication and authorization system
4. Create essential API endpoints
5. Develop basic frontend components
6. Integrate payment processing
7. Implement analytics and reporting features

## Technical Stack Confirmation:
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Payments**: Razorpay
- **Deployment**: Docker (Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml present)
